# Iâ€™m Jesse

Hey there! I'm Jesse.

## Coding

I'm a C# coder with medium knowledge about it. I use C# in Unity.
I like to code stuff from game source code, for example the OpenDriver2 Project.
I would like to collaborate on reverse engineering Driver San Francisco Wii.

## Games

I'm currently working on Driver Reseen. It's basically Driver San Francisco Wii, but in Unity Engine. This project will remain closed source, since it contains Edy's Vehicle Physics, which is a licensed asset
